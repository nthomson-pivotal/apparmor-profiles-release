# AppArmor Profile BOSH Release

This BOSH release is designed to act as an addon to apply AppArmor profiles to Xenial-based BOSH VMs.
It is left up to the user to create appropriate AppArmor profiles to satify their restrictions.

## Adding Profiles

Currently you must add profiles directly to the repository and rebuild the release to deploy. The overall
steps are:

- Generate your profile using the likes of `aa-genprof`
- Create a file in `jobs/apparmor-profiles/templates` that matches the name generated by `aa-genprof`
- Add an entry to the `profiles` property in `jobs/apparmor-profiles/spec` that matches the name of your templates
- Create and deploy a release
